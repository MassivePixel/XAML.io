# XAML.io

XAML stands for eXtensible Application Markup Language and is used to build UI declaratively. It is used primarily by Microsoft in their desktop and mobile platforms. More recently, it is the best way to build UI for cross platform applications using Xamarin.Forms.

This wiki serves as a both guidelines for writing applications on Windows platforms (Windows Phone/Store/Mobile/UWP) and as a learning guide for all aspects of mobile development on XAML platforms.

Please note that while guidelines are heavily opinionated, rationale for each one will be provided. The wiki itself is not a complete reference for learning Windows Phone/Store/Universal development. If you are a beginner in Windows development, it will provide a list of things to learn. For seasoned developers this might serve as a reminder for some special scenarios.

Happy reading.
